%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  Numerous studies have been conducted to research learning environments. In this paper a conversational agent is introduced, which uses a range of techniques to automate and improve the learning experience of math students. The robot has functionalities to explain, train and test students to perform a rudimentary math skill. It also incorporates an emotion classifier to decide on an approach given the affective behaviour of the user.
